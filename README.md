#SimpleHasher
Hi guys happt to see you here,
SimpleHasher is all about making your hashing works simpler.You can invoke it to your projects just by importing simple-haser into your code by

npm install simple-hasher 
after installation
use require('simple-hasher') to use it in your project

. After importing you can use a method called 
#hasher(data,type);
it takes two parameters,first is the string of data or fileName that you want to hash and second one is the type,whether you are hashing the string value or the file.
1.For string value just pass the string or if it is a file,then pass the fileName as a string.
2.To mention a type parameter,if it is a string the use the parameter as 'string' if you are hashing the file then mention it as 'file'
thats it guys feel free to contact me:[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vskandhan/)
